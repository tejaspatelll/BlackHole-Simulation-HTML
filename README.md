# ‚ú® HTML Black Hole Simulation ‚ú®

Welcome! This project renders an interactive simulation of a black hole and its dynamic environment using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on an HTML Canvas element. Explore gravitational effects like accretion disks, spaghettification, and parallax scrolling with interactive zoom.

## üöÄ Features

*   **Dynamic Black Hole:** A central event horizon that scales interactively with zoom.
*   **Accretion Disk:** Thousands of particles orbit the black hole, simulating Doppler shifts, relativistic beaming, density waves, and flickering based on physics approximations.
*   **Falling Stars:** Stars are randomly generated and gravitationally pulled towards the black hole.
*   **Spaghettification:** Stars passing close to the event horizon exhibit a realistic stretching effect along their trajectory.
*   **Parallax Background:** A field of distant stars demonstrates parallax shift during zoom, adding depth.
*   **Interactive Zoom:** Use your mouse wheel to seamlessly zoom in for detail or zoom out for a wider perspective.
*   **Responsive Design:** The simulation dynamically adapts to your browser window size.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

1.  **Save the Code:** Copy the HTML code provided into a file named `blackhole.html` (or any name ending in `.html`).
2.  **Open in Browser:** Launch the saved `blackhole.html` file using a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
3.  **Explore:** The simulation will start automatically and fill the browser window.

##üñ±Ô∏è Interaction

*   **Zoom In/Out:** Hover your mouse cursor over the canvas and use the **mouse wheel** to adjust the zoom level.
    *   Scroll **Up/Forward**: Zoom In
    *   Scroll **Down/Backward**: Zoom Out
