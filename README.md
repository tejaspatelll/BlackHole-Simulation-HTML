# HTML Black Hole Simulation

This project simulates a black hole and its surrounding environment using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, rendered on an HTML Canvas. It includes an accretion disk, falling stars subject to gravity and spaghettification, background stars with parallax, and interactive zoom.

## Features

*   **Black Hole:** A central black event horizon that scales with zoom.
*   **Accretion Disk:** Thousands of particles orbiting the black hole with varying colors, brightness, and speeds based on simulated physics (including Doppler shift approximations). Particles have trails and flicker effects.
*   **Falling Stars:** Stars randomly spawn and are pulled towards the black hole by gravity.
*   **Spaghettification:** Falling stars that pass close to the black hole exhibit a stretching effect (spaghettification) along their trail.
*   **Background Stars:** A static field of background stars that demonstrates a parallax effect when zooming.
*   **Interactive Zoom:** Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out of the simulation, revealing more detail or a wider view.
*   **Responsive:** The simulation adapts to the browser window size.

## How to Run

1.  Save the provided HTML code into a file named `blackhole.html` (or any other `.html` name).
2.  Open the `blackhole.html` file in a modern web browser (such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari).
3.  The simulation will automatically start and fill the browser window.

## Interaction

*   **Zoom:** Place your mouse cursor over the simulation canvas and use the **mouse wheel** to zoom in (scroll up) or zoom out (scroll down).

## Screenshots
